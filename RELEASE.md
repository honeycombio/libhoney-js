# Release Process

- Use `npm version --no-git-tag-version` to update the version number using `major`, `minor`, `patch`, or the prerelease variants `premajor`, `preminor`, or `prepatch`.
  For example, to bump from v1.1.1 to the next patch version:

```shell
> npm version --no-git-tag-version patch # 1.1.1 -> 1.1.2
```

- Confirm the version number update appears in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the changes since the last release. Consider automating with a command such as these two:
  - `git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --no-merges --oneline > new-in-this-release.log`
  - `git log --pretty='%C(green)%d%Creset- %s | [%an](https://github.com/)'`
- Commit changes, push, and open a release preparation pull request for review.
- Once the pull request is merged, fetch the updated `main` branch.
- Apply a tag for the new version on the merged commit (e.g. `git tag -a v2.3.1 -m "v2.3.1"`)
- Push the tag upstream (this will kick off the release pipeline in CI) e.g. `git push origin v2.3.1`
- Ensure that there is a draft GitHub release created as part of CI publish steps (this will also publish to NPM).
- Click "generate release notes" in GitHub for full changelog notes and any new contributors
- Publish the GitHub draft release
