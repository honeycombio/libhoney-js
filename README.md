A Node.js module for sending events to [Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io), a service for debugging your software in production.
For tracing support and automatic instrumentation of Express and other common libraries, check out our [Beeline for NodeJS](https://github.com/honeycombio/beeline-nodejs).

### Releasing a new version

Use `npm version --no-git-tag-version` to update the version number using `major`, `minor`, `patch`, or the prerelease variants `premajor`, `preminor`, or `prepatch`. We use `--no-git-tag-version` to avoid automatically tagging - tagging with the version automatically triggers a CI run that publishes, and we only want to do that upon merging the PR into `main`.

After doing this, follow our usual instructions for the actual process of tagging and releasing the package.
